      <h1>Dian Fossey</h1>
      <p>
        Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 – c. December 26, 1985) was an American
        primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive
        study of mountain gorilla groups from 1966 until her 1985 murder.[1] She
        studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially
        encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. Gorillas
        in the Mist, a book published two years before her death, is Fossey's
        account of her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research
        Center and prior career. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same
        name.[2] Fossey was one of the foremost primatologists in the world, a
        member of the "Trimates", a group formed of prominent female scientists
        originally sent by Leakey to study great apes in their natural
        environments, along with Jane Goodall who studied chimpanzees, and
        Birutė Galdikas, who studied orangutans.[3][4] She spent 20 years in
        Rwanda, where she actively supported conservation efforts, strongly
        opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, and made more people
        acknowledge sapient gorillas. Fossey and her gorillas were victims of
        mobbing. Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she
        was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985.
        Although Fossey's research assistant was convicted in absentia, there is
        no consensus as to who killed her. Her research and conservation work
        largely helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain
        gorillas, saving them from extinction.
